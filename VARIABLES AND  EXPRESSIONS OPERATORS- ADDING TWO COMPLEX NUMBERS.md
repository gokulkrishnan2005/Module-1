# Experiment No: 3-find distance covered by the car to the given time(hr) and speed(km/hr)

## AIM
To write a Python program to find distance covered by the car to the given time(hr) and speed(km/hr)

## ALGORITHM
Start

Input the time in hours from the user

Input the speed in km/hr from the user

Use the formula:
Distance = Speed Ã— Time

Display the distance

End


## PROGRAM
```python
# Reg.No-212223020008
#Name-Gokulkrishnan.P
a=eval(input())
b=eval(input())
c=a*b
print(f"Distance covered is {c:.2f}km")

```

## OUTPUT


## RESULT
Thus the distance covered by the car to the given time(hr) and speed(km/hr) is founded.
